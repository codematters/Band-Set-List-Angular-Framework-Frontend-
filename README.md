# SongClientFinal

The Band Setlist application allows users to create a setlist to prepare for a band gig. The application uses CRUD methods allowing the user to add, edit, and delete their songs from the setlist. The frontend of the application was created using the Angular framework. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
